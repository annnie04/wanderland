title: 1st 1% - 'Pycurl import error:libcurl link-time version is older than compile-time version'
---

Thank you for visiting my first post on my new blog. I hope you enjoying wandering with me!

I got into below error while trying to import Pycurl (I was running on macOS Ventura).
-- Import error: pycurl: libcurl link-time version (7.77.0) is older than compile-time version (7.79.1) --

Below solution worked for me after trying out several guides.
The main idea is to install brew version of curl and force linking it to get an u-to-date curl.

```ruby
#uninstall Pycurl and run these lines of command in Terminal:
brew install curl
brew link curl --force
brew install openssl

#export variables so that compiler can find them
export LDFLAGS="-L/opt/homebrew/opt/openssl@3/lib"
export CPPFLAGS="-I/opt/homebrew/opt/openssl@3/include"
echo 'export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/openssl@3/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zprofile

#install pycurl
pip --no-cache-dir install pycurl

#test import pycurl
python3 -c 'import pycurl'
```

Hope it helps! :)
